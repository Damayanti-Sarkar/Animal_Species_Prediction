# Animal_Species_Prediction
This is a task based on Animal Species Prediction where we use deep learning models, python  packages and libraries, and the renowned ResNet50 model which all together can accurately classify animals with remarkable precision.
In this code after loading and preprocessing the image, we make and display the predictions after analyzing the image.
